Compute 1D PMF of Butane Dihedral
=================================

This example includes a step-by-step discription on computing the PMF of butane dihedral with umbrella sampling and FastMBAR.
Umbrella sampling is used to exhaustively sample relavant butane configurations that are centered around multiple dihedral values.
FastMBAR is used here to compute the PMF by reweighting the configurations sampled from umbrella sampling.
