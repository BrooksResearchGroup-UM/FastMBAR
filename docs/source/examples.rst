Examples
========

All following examples require running molecular dynamics (MD).
Here, in these examples, we will use `OpenMM <http://openmm.org>`_ whenever we need to run MD.
Therefore, if you want to run the following examples step by step on your computer, you need
to install `OpenMM`_. If you have installed `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_,  you can easily install `OpenMM`_
by following the instruction at `OpenMM Install <http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#installing-openmm>`_.
Although `OpenMM`_ is used in these examples, any other choices of MD engines, such as CHARMM, Gromacs, and Amber, can be used too.
Therefore, no matter what kind of MD engine you use in your study, you can always use FastMBAR to analyze samples from your simulations.
